John and Mary are high-ranking government officials who live in Washington DC.
A mysterious package was just found on their front porch.
Mary suspects that it could the pillow she ordered last month from "Pillows-R-Us".
John isn't aware of this and he suspects that there is a bomb inside, so 911 is called.
Despite what each of them imagines, there really is just a pillow in the box.
In the end, 911 operator isn't convinced and needs to know who is responsible for this waste of taxpayer funds.
