Mary and John are high-ranking government officials who live in Washington DC.
They have just found a mysterious package on their front porch. And they are
arguing about what this package might contain. Mary suspects that there is a
bomb inside. John is more measured, so he imagines that it has more benign
contents, namely the pillow they ordered last month. The fact of the matter is
that there really is a pillow in the box.
