John and Mary are high-ranking government officials who live in Washington DC.
They have just found a mysterious package on their front porch.  John suspects
that there is a bomb inside, and has called the bomb squad just to be sure. But,
the box is labelled “Pillows-R-Us”, so it could just be the pillow Mary ordered
last month. If there is a bomb, John needs to get his elderly in-laws out of 
the house. The fact of the matter is that there really is a pillow in the box.
