John and Mary are high-ranking government officials who live in Washington DC.
A mysterious package was just found on their front porch.
The box is labelled “Pillows-R-Us”, so it could just be the pillow Mary ordered last month.
John isn't aware of this and he suspects that there is a bomb inside, so the bomb squad is called.
The fact of the matter is that there really is just a pillow in the box.
But the bomb squad needs to discover this so they know whether to evacute the elderly home next door.
